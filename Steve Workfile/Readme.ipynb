    "Seasonal records are under a different scope than career records, as there are many more of them and they might combine awkwardly at best. One way we can handle this is to quantify them in a way that stands up to being summed while allowing them to remain distinct from career records.  \n",
    "For that, I've taken inspiration from Bill James' Hall Of Fame Monitor, which awards points to players based on seasonal and career achievements. For the present purpose, we'll represent seasonal stats with HOF Monitor points, which are describe on the following sheet.  \n",
    "I have determined the rate that these type of seasons occur and found that points are awarded at a rate that is pretty commeasurate with frequency of occurance. Doubles are an exception,  but this is a somewhat less prominent stat.  To James' original specs, I am adding stolen bases and slugging percentage and proposing rating points accordingly.  Also, noting that home runs standards frequencies are similar to batting average, I have made that slight adjustment.  \n",
